# Visualization Course

For this course we had to impleent a volume rendering using Raycasting.
Practically, we had to implement both **Maximum Intensity Projection(MIP)+* and **Compositing raycasting** in order to visualize an orange dataset.

By using volume rendering, data samples are projected onto the picture plane and this allows us to display more detailed images compared to geometric primitives approaches. 
The main idea with raycasting is, as the name suggests, a ray which is cast and equidistant points are sampled. In order to get a better resolution, the voxel value is obtained by using trilinear interpolation.


To get more information read the *report* in the repo.

I must point out that all the code implemented is in the **implementation.py** while the other *.py files have been made by the course organizers.
